This was a project created to experiment with machine learning and GAN image processing.

Unfortunately I don't have an nvidia gpu and AMDs support for machine learning is next to none.

What I did was train the model with images of myself and with the help of a discriminator running on my cpu. I had to utilize checkpoints since training a neural network on a CPU alone does take some time

Here are some of the best results that I have gotten from my neural net
